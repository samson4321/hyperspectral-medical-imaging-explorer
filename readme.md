# Hyperspectral Imaging in Medicine  
### Interactive Anatomical Region–Based Literature Explorer

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an **interactive web-based interface** for exploring the applications of **hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in medicine**, organized by **anatomical regions**.  

Hyperspectral imaging is a non-invasive imaging technique that captures detailed spectral information across hundreds of wavelengths, enabling advanced tissue characterization, perfusion assessment, and disease analysis across multiple medical domains.

The goal of this project is to provide a **structured, anatomy-driven way to explore hyperspectral imaging literature**, without manually searching across multiple platforms.
